[ENJOLRAS]
Marius, rest

[FEUILLY]
Drink with me to days gone by
Sing with me the songs we knew

[PROUVAIRE]
Here's to pretty girls who went to our heads

[JOLY]
Here's to witty girls who went to our beds

[ALL]â€‹
Here's to them and here's to you!

[GRANTAIRE]
Drink with me to days gone by
Can it be you fear to die?
Will the world remember you
When you fall?
Could it be your death
Means nothing at all?
Is your life just one more lie?

[MEN]
Drink with me
To days
Gone by
To the life
That used
To be

[WOMEN]
Drink with me
To days
Gone by
To the life
That used
To be

[WOMEN]
At the shrine of friendship, never say die

[ALL]
Let the wine of friendship never run dry

[MEN]
Here's to you
And here's
To me

[WOMEN]
Here's to you
And here's
To me

[MARIUS]
Do I care if I should die
Now she goes across the sea?
Life without Cosette means nothing at all
Would you weep, Cosette, should Marius fall?
Will you weep, Cosette
For me?
