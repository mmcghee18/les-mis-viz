[JAVERT]
There, out in the darkness
A fugitive running
Fallen from God, fallen from grace
God be my witness
I never shall yield
Till we come face to face
Till we come face to face

He knows his way in the dark
But mine is the way of the Lord
Those who follow the path of the righteous
Shall have their reward
And if they fall as Lucifer fell
The flame, the sword

Stars, in your multitudes
Scarce to be counted
Filling the darkness with order and light
You are the sentinels
Silent and sure
Keeping watch in the night
Keeping watch in the night

You know your place in the sky
You hold your course and your aim
And each in your season returns and returns
And is always the same
And if you fall as Lucifer fell
You fall in flame

And so it must be
For so it is written
On the doorway to paradise
That those who falter and those who fall
Must pay the price

Lord let me find him
That I may see him
Safe behind bars
I will never rest
Till then, this I swear
This I swear by the stars!

[GAVROCHE]
That inspector thinks he's something
But it's me that runs this town
And my theater never closes
And the curtain's never down
Trust Gavroche, have no fear
Don't you worry, auntie dear
You can always find me here
