[PRISONERS]
Aaah, aah, aaaahhhh
Aaah, aah, aaaahhhh
Aaah, aah, aaaahhhh
Aaah, aah, aaaahhhh

Look down, look down
Don't look 'em in the eye
Look down, look down
You're here until you die

[PRISONER #1]
The sun is strong
It's hot as Hell below

[PRISONERS]
Look down, look down
There's twenty years to go

[PRISONER #2]
I've done no wrong
Sweet Jesus, hear my prayer

[PRISONERS]
Look down, look down
Sweet Jesus doesn't care

[PRISONER #3]
I know she'll wait
I know that she'll be true

[PRISONERS]
Look down, look down
They've all forgotten you

[PRISONER #4]
When I get free you won't see me
Here for dust

[PRISONERS]
Look down, look down
Don't look 'em in the eye

[PRISONER #5]
How long, oh Lord
Before you let me die?

[PRISONERS]
Look down, look down
You'll always be a slave
Look down, look down
You're standing in your grave

[JAVERT]
Now bring me Prisoner 24601
Your time is up
And your parole's begun
You know what that means

[VALJEAN]
Yes, it means I'm free

[JAVERT]
No!
It means you get your yellow ticket-of-leave
You are a thief

[VALJEAN]
I stole a loaf of bread

[JAVERT]
You robbed a house!

[VALJEAN]
I broke a window pane
My sister's child was close to death
And we were starving

[JAVERT]
You will starve again
Unless you learn the meaning of the law

[VALJEAN]
I know the meaning of those nineteen years
A slave of the law

[JAVERT]
Five years for what you did
The rest because you tried to run
Yes, 24601

[VALJEAN]
My name is Jean Valjean!

[JAVERT]
And I'm Javert
Do not forget my name
Do not forget me, 24601

[PRISONERS]
Look down, look down
You'll always be a slave
Look down, look down
You're standing in your grave
Aaah, aah, aaaahhhh
