[ENJOLRAS]
She is the first to fall
The first of us to fall upon this barricade

[MARIUS]
Her name was Ã‰ponine
Her life was cold and dark, yet she was unafraid

[COMBEFERRE]
We fight here in her name

[PROUVAIRE]
She will not die in vain

[BOSSUET]
She will not be betrayed

[JOLY]
Here comes a man in uniform
What brings you to this place?

[VALJEAN]
I come here as a volunteer

[JOLY]
Approach and show your face

[SENTRY]
You wear an army uniform

[VALJEAN]
That's why they let me through

[JOLY]
You've got some years behind you, sir

[VALJEAN]
There's much that I can do

[JOLY]
You see that prisoner over there?

[GRANTAIRE]
A volunteer like you!

[COMBEFERRE]
A spy who calls himself Javert!

[GRANTAIRE]
He's going to get it, too

[SENTRY]
They're getting ready to attack!

[ENJOLRAS]
Take this and use it well!
But if you shoot us in the back
You'll never live to tell!
