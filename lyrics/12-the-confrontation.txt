[JAVERT]
Valjean, at last, we see each other plain
"M'sieur le maire," you'll wear a different chain

[VALJEAN]
Before you say another word, Javert
Before you chain me up like a slave again
Listen to me! There is something I must do

This woman leaves behind a suffering child
There is none but me who can intercede
In mercy's name, three days are all I need

Then I'll return, I pledge my word
Then I'll returnâ€”

[JAVERT]
You must think me mad
I've hunted you across the years
Men like you can never change
A man, such as you

[VALJEAN]
Believe of me
What you will
There is a duty that I'm sworn to do
You know nothing of my life
All I did was steal some bread	

[JAVERT]
Men like me can never change
Men like you can never change
No!
24601...

[VALJEAN]
You know nothing of the world
You would sooner see me dead
But not before I see this justice done

[JAVERT]
My duty's to the law
You have no rights
Come with me, 24601
Now the wheel has turned around
Jean Valjean is nothing now

[VALJEAN]
I am warning you, Javert
I'm a stronger man by far
There is power in me yet
My race is not yet run!	

[JAVERT]
Dare you talk to me of crime
And the price you had to pay
Every man is born in sin
Every man must choose his way

[VALJEAN]
I am warning you, Javert
There is nothing I won't dare
If I have to kill you here
I'll do what must be done!	

[JAVERT]
You know nothing of Javert
I was born inside a jail
I was born with scum like you
I am from the gutter, too

[VALJEAN]
And this I swear to you tonight

[JAVERT]
There is no place for you to hide

[VALJEAN]
Your child will live within my care

[JAVERT]
Wherever you may hide away

[VALJEAN]
And I will raise her to the light	

[VALJEAN and JAVERT]
I swear to you, I will be there
