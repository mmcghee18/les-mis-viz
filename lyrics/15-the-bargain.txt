[VALJEAN]
I found her wandering in the wood
This little child, I found her trembling in the shadows
And I am here to help Cosette
And I will settle any debt you may think proper
I will pay what I must pay
To take Cosette away

There is a duty I must heed
There is a promise I have made
For I was blind to one in need
I did not see what stood before me

Now her mother is with God
Fantine's suffering is over
And I speak here with her voice
And I stand here in her place

[VALJEAN]
And from this day and evermore

[MADAME THENARDIER]
Let me have your coat, M'sieur

[VALJEAN]
Cosette shall live in my protection

[THENARDIER]
You are very welcome here

[VALJEAN]
I shall not forsake my vow

[THENARDIER]
Take a glass

[MADAME THENARDIER]
Take a chair

[VALJEAN]
Cosette shall have a father now	

[THENARDIER (grabbing and 'hugging' Young Cosette)]
What to do, what to say
Shall you carry our treasure away?
What a gem, what a pearl
Beyond rubies is our little girl
How can we speak of debt
Let's not haggle for darling Cosette

Dear Fantine, gone to rest
Have we done for her child what is best
Shared our bread, shared each bone
Treated her like she's one of our own
Like our own, Monsieur

[VALJEAN]
Your feelings do you credit, sir
And I will ease the parting blow
Let us not talk of bargains or bones or greed
Now, may I say we are agreed?

[MADAME THENARDIER]
That would quite fit the bill
If she hadn't so often been ill
Little dear, cost us dear
Medicines are expensive, M'sieur
Not that we begrudged a sou
It's no more than we Christians must do

[THENARDIER and MADAME THENARDIER]
One thing more, one small doubt
There are treacherous people about
No offense, please reflect
Your intentions may not be correct

[VALJEAN (paying them)]
No more words, here's your price
Fifteen hundred for your sacrifice
Come, Cosette, say goodbye
Let us seek out some friendlier sky
Thank you both for Cosette
It won't take you too long to forget

[VALJEAN]
Come, Cosette, come, my dear
From now on I will always be here
Where I go, you will be

[YOUNG COSETTE]
Will there be children and castles to see?

[VALJEAN]
Yes, Cosette, yes, it's true
There's a castle just waiting for you
