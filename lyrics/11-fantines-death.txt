[FANTINE (lying in a hospital bed, delirious)]
Cosette, it's turned so cold
Cosette, it's past your bedtime
You've played the day away
And soon it will be night

Come to me, Cosette, the light is fading
Don't you see the evening star appearing?
Come to me, and rest against my shoulder
How fast the minutes fly away and every minute colder

Hurry near, another day is dying
Don't you hear, the winter wind is crying?
There's a darkness which comes without a warning
But I will sing you lullabies and wake you in the morning

[VALJEAN (arriving)]
Oh, Fantine, our time is running out
But Fantine, I swear this on my life

[FANTINE]
Look, M'sieur, where all the children play

[VALJEAN]
Be at peace, be at peace evermore

[FANTINE]
My Cosetteâ€”

[VALJEAN]
Shall live in my protection

[FANTINE]
Take her now

[VALJEAN]
Your child will want for nothing

[FANTINE]
Good M'sieur, you come from God in Heaven

[VALJEAN]
And none shall ever harm Cosette
As long as I am living

[FANTINE]
Take my hand
The night grows ever colder

[VALJEAN]
Then I will keep you warm

[FANTINE]
Take my child
I give her to your keeping

[VALJEAN]
Take shelter from the storm 

[FANTINE]
For God's sake, please stay till I am sleeping
And tell Cosette I love her
And I'll see her when I wake
