[ENJOLRAS]
Fire!

[ENJOLRAS]
How do we stand, Feuilly?
Make your report

[FEUILLY]
We've guns enough
But ammunition's short

[MARIUS]
Let me go into the streets
There are bodies all around
Ammunition to be had
Lots of bullets to be found!

[ENJOLRAS]
I won't let you go
It's too much of a chance

[MARIUS]
And the same is true
For any man here!

[VALJEAN]
Let me go, he's no more than a boy
I am old, I have nothing to fear

[GAVROCHE]
You need somebody quicker
And I volunteer!

[BOSSUET]
Come back, Gavroche, don't you dare!

[JOLY]
Someone pull him down at once!

[GAVROCHE]
Look at me, I'm almost there!

[GAVROCHE (collecting ammunition from bodies)]
Little people know, when
Little people fight, we
May look easy pickings
But we've got some bite!

[GAVROCHE (pained)]
...So never kick a dog
Because he's just a pup...

[GAVROCHE (struggling)]
....We'll fight like twenty armies
And we won't give up!

[GAVROCHE (weakly)]
So you'd better run for cover
When the pup growsâ€”
