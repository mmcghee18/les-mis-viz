[BAMATABOIS]
Here's something new, I think I'll give it a try
Come closer, you. I like to see what I buy
The usual price for just one slice of your pie

[FANTINE]
I don't want you. No, no, Monsieur, let me go

[BAMATABOIS]
Is this a trick? I won't pay more

[FANTINE]
No, not at all

[BAMATABOIS]
You've got some nerve, you little whore
You've got some gall

It's the same with a tart as it is with a grocer
The customer sees what he gets in advance
It's not for the whore to say "yes sir" or "no sir"
Not for the harlot to pick or to choose
Or to lead me a dance

[FANTINE (striking Bamatabois)]
I'll kill you you bastard, try any of that
Even a whore who has gone to the bad
Won't be had by a rat

[BAMATABOIS]
By Christ, you'll pay for what you've done
This rat will make you bleed you'll see
I guarantee, I'll make you suffer
For this disturbance of the peace
For this insult to life and property

[FANTINE]
I beg you, don't report me sir
I'll do what ever you may want

[BAMATABOIS]
Make your excuse to the police

[JAVERT]
Tell me quickly what's the story
Who saw what and why and where
Let him give a full description
Let him answer to Javert

In this nest of whores and vipers
Let one speak who saw it all
Who laid hands on this good man here?
What's the substance of this brawl?

[BAMATABOIS]
Javert, would you believe it
I was crossing from the park
When this prostitute attacked me
You can see she left her mark

[JAVERT]
She will answer for her actions
When you make a full report
You may rest assured, Monsieur
That she will answer to the court

[FANTINE]
There's a child who sorely needs me
Please Monsieur, she's but that high
Holy God, is there no mercy?
If I go to jail, she'll die

[JAVERT]
I have heard such protestation
Every day for twenty years
Let's have no more explanations
Save your breath and save your tears
Honest work, just reward
That's the way to please the Lord

[VALJEAN]
A moment of your time, Javert
I do believe this woman's tale

[JAVERT]
But Monsieur Mayorâ€”

[VALJEAN]
You've done your duty, let her be
She needs a doctor, not a jail

[JAVERT]
But Monsieur Mayor!

[FANTINE]
Can this be?

[VALJEAN]
Where will she end
This child without a friend?

I've seen your face before
Show me some way to help you
How have you come to grief
In such a place as this?

[FANTINE]
Monsieur, don't mock me now, I pray
It's hard enough I've lost my pride
You let your foreman send me away
Yes, you were there, and turned aside

[FANTINE]
I never did no wrong

[VALJEAN]
Is it true, what I've done

[FANTINE]
My daughter's close to dying

[VALJEAN]
To an innocent soul?

[FANTINE]
If there's a God above

[VALJEAN]
Had I only known then...

[FANTINE]
He'd let me die instead
 
[VALJEAN]
In His name, my task has just begun
I will see it done

[JAVERT]
But Monsieur Mayor!

[VALJEAN]
I will see it done

[JAVERT]
But Monsieur Mayor!

[VALJEAN]
I will see it done

[VOICE (spoken)]
Look out, it's a runaway cart!
