[VALJEAN (with only a bare wooden cross for company)]
Alone, I wait in the shadows
I count the hours till I can sleep
I dreamed a dream Cosette stood by
It made her weep to know I die

Alone at the end of the day
Upon this wedding night, I pray
Take these children, my Lord, to thy embrace
And show them grace

God on high, hear my prayer
Take me now to thy care
Where You are, let me be
Take me now, take me there

Bring me home
Bring me home

[FANTINE]
Monsieur, I bless your name
Monsieur, lay down your burden
You raised my child in love	

[VALJEAN]
I am ready, Fantine
At the end of my days
She's the best of my life

[FANTINE]
And you will be with God

[COSETTE]
Papa, Papa, I do not understand!
Are you alright? They said you'd gone away

[VALJEAN]
Cosette, my child, am I forgiven now?
Thank God, thank God, I've lived to see this day

[MARIUS]
It's you who must forgive a thoughtless fool
It's you who must forgive a thankless man
It's thanks to you that I am living
And again I lay down my life at your feet

Cosette, your father is a saint
When they wounded me
He took me from the barricade
Carried like a babe
And brought me home to you!

[VALJEAN]
Now you are here
Again, beside me
Now, I can die in peace
For now my life is blessed

[Cosette]
You will live!
Papa, you're going to live!
It's too soon
Too soon to say goodbye

[Valjean]
Yes, Cosette
Forbid me now to die
I'll obey... I will try...

On this page
I write my last confession
Read it well
When I, at last, am sleeping
It's the story
Of those who always loved you:

Your mother gave her life for you
And gave you to my keeping

[FANTINE (beckoning)]
Come with me
Where chains will never bind you
All your grief
At last, at last, behind you
Lord in Heaven
Look down on him in mercy

[VALJEAN]
Forgive me all my trespasses
And take me to Your glory

[FANTINE and EPONINE]
Take my hand
And lead me to salvation
Take my love
For love is everlasting

[VALJEAN and FANTINE and EPONINE]
And remember
The truth that once was spoken:

To love another person is to see the face of God!

[ENSEMBLE (softly, gaining strength)]
Do you hear the people sing?
Lost in the valley of the night
It is the music of a people
Who are climbing to the light

For the wretched of the Earth
There is a flame that never dies
Even the darkest night will end
And the sun will rise

They will live again in freedom
In the garden of the Lord
They will walk behind the ploughshare
They will put away the sword

The chain will be broken
And all men will have their reward

Who will join in our crusade?
Who will be strong and stand with me?
Somewhere beyond the barricade
Is there a world you long to see?

Do you hear the people sing?
Say, do you hear the distant drums?
It is the future that they bring
When tomorrow comes!

Aah, aah, aah
Tomorrow comes!
