[VALJEAN]
One day more
Another day, another destiny
This never ending road to Calvary
These men who seem to know my crime
Will surely come a second time
One day more

[MARIUS]
I did not live until today
How can I live when we are parted?

[VALJEAN]
One day more

[MARIUS and COSETTE]
Tomorrow you'll be worlds away
And yet with you, my world has started

[EPONINE]
One more day all on my own

[MARIUS and COSETTE]
Will we ever meet again?

[EPONINE]
One more day with him not caring

[MARIUS and COSETTE]
I was born to be with you

[EPONINE]
What a life I might have known

[MARIUS and COSETTE]
And I swear I will be true!

[EPONINE]
But he never saw me there

[ENJOLRAS]
One more day before the storm
At the barricades of Freedom
When our ranks begin to form
Will you take your place with me?

[MARIUS]
Do I follow where she goes?
Shall I join my brothers there?
Do I stay or do I dare?

[ALL]
The time is now
The day is here

[VALJEAN]
One day more!

[JAVERT]
One more day till revolution
We will nip it in the bud
We'll be ready for these schoolboys
They will wet themselves with blood!

[VALJEAN]
One day more!

[THENARDIER and MADAME THENARDIER]
Watch them run amuck
Catch'm as they fall
Never know your luck
When there's a free for all
Here a little dip
There a little touch
Most of them are goners
So they won't miss much!

[STUDENTS]
One day to a new beginning
Raise the flag of freedom high!
Every man will be a king
Every man will be a king
There's a new world for the winning
There's a new world to be won
Do you hear the people sing?

[MARIUS]
My place is here
I fight with you!

[VALJEAN]
One day more!

[MARIUS and COSETTE]
I did not live until today
Tomorrow you'll be worlds away
And yet with you my world has started

[EPONINE]
One more day all on my own

[JAVERT]
I will join these people's heroes
I will follow where they go
I will know their little secrets
I will know the things they know

[VALJEAN]
One day more!

[THENARDIER and MADAME THENARDIER]
Watch 'em run amuck
Catch 'em as they fall
Never know your luck
When there's a free-for-all

[JAVERT]
One more day to revolution
We will nip it in the bud
We'll be ready for these schoolboys
Tomorrow is the judgement day

[VALJEAN]
Tomorrow we'll be far away
Tomorrow is the judgement day

[ALL]
Tomorrow we'll discover
What our God in Heaven has in store!
One more dawn
One more day
One day more!
