[JOLY (spoken)]
There's a boy climbing the barricade!

[MARIUS]
Good God! What are you doing?
'Ponine, have you no fear?
Have you seen my beloved?
Why have you come back here?

[EPONINE]
Took the letter like you said
I met her father at the door
He said he would give it
I don't think I can stand anymore

[MARIUS]
Éponine, what's wrong?
I feel there's something wet upon your hair
Éponine, you're hurt! You need some help
Oh, God! It's everywhere!

[EPONINE]
Don't you fret, M'sieur Marius. I don't feel any pain
A little fall of rain, can hardly hurt me now
You're here. That's all I need to know
And you will keep me safe
And you will keep me close
And rain will make the flowers grow

[MARIUS]
But you will live, 'Ponine, dear God above
If I could heal your wounds with words of love

[EPONINE]
Just hold me now, and let it be
Shelter me, comfort me

[MARIUS]
You would live a hundred years, if I could show you how
I won't desert you now...

[EPONINE]
The rain can't hurt me now
This rain will wash away what's past
And you will keep me safe
And you will keep me close
I’ll sleep in your embrace at last

The rain that brings you here is heaven blessed
The skies begin to clear, and I'm at rest
A breath away from where you are
I've come home from so far

[MARIUS]
Hush-a-bye, dear Éponine
You won't feel any pain
A little fall of rain
Can hardly hurt you now	

[EPONINE]
So don't you fret, M'sieur Marius
I don't feel any pain
A little fall of rain
Can hardly hurt me now

[MARIUS]
I'm here

[EPOININE]
That's all I need to know

[EPONINE]
And you will keep me safe
And you will keep me close

[MARIUS]
I'll stay with you
'Till you are sleeping

[EPONINE]
And rain...

[MARIUS]
And rain

[EPONINE]
Will make the flowers...

[MARIUS]
Will make the flowers

[MARIUS (alone)]
Grow
