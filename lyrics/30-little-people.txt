[GAVROCHE]
Good evening, dear Inspector. Lovely evening, my dear
I know this man, my friends, his name's Inspector Javert
So don't believe a word he says 'cos none of it's true
This only goes to show what little people can do

And little people know when little people fight
We may look easy pickings but we've got some bite
So never kick a dog because he's just a pup
We'll fight like twenty armies and we won't give up
So you'd better run for cover when the pup grows up

[GRANTAIRE]
Bravo, little Gavroche! You're the top of the class!

[PROUVAIRE]
So what're we gonna do with this snake in the grass?

[ENJOLRAS]
Tie this man and take him to the tavern in there
The people will decide your fate, Inspector Javert!

[VARIOUS STUDENTS]
Take the bastard now and shoot him!
Let us watch the devil dance!
You'd have done the same, Inspector
If we'd let you have your chance

[JAVERT]
Shoot me now or shoot me later
Every schoolboy to his sport
Death to each and every traitor
I renounce your people's court

[COMBEFERRE]
Though we may not all survive here
There are things that never die

[GRANTAIRE]
What's the difference, die a schoolboy
Die a policemen, die a spy?

[ENJOLRAS]
Take this man, bring him through
There is work we have to do
