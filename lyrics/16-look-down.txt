[BEGGARS]
Look down and see the beggars at your feet
Look down and show some mercy if you can
Look down and see the sweepings of the street
Look down, look down, upon your fellow man

[GAVROCHE (Beggars continuing in background)]
How do you do? My name's Gavroche
These are my people, here's my patch
Not much to look at, nothing posh
Nothing that you'd call up to scratch
This is my school, my high society
Here in the slums of Saint Michel
We live on crumbs of humble piety
Tough on the teeth, but what the hell
Think you're poor, think you're free
Follow me, follow me!

[BEGGARS]
Look down, and show some mercy if you can
Look down, look down upon your fellow man

[OLD BEGGAR WOMAN]
What you think you're at
Hanging round me pitch
If you're new around here, girl
You've got a lot to learn

[YOUNG PROSTITUTE]
Listen you old bat
Crazy bloody witch
'Least I give my customers
Some pleasure in return

[OLD BEGGAR WOMAN]
I know what you give
Give 'em all the pox
Spread around your poison
Till they end up in a box

[PIMP]
Leave the poor old cow
Move it, Madeleine
She used to be no better
Till the clap got to her brain

[BEGGARS]
When's it gonna end
When we gonna live
Something's gotta happen now or
Something's gonna give
It'll come, it'll come, it'll come
It'll come, it'll come, it'll come

[ENJOLRAS]
Where are the leaders of the land?
Where are the swells who run this show?

[MARIUS]
Only one man and that's LaMarque
Speaks for the people here below

[BEGGARS]
See our children fed
Help us in our shame
Something for a crust of bread
In Holy Jesus' name

[URCHIN]
In the Lord's Holy name

[BEGGARS]
In his name, in his name, in his name

[MARIUS]
LaMarque is ill and fading fast
Won't last the week out so they say

[ENJOLRAS]
With all the anger in the land
How long before the judgement day
Before we cut the fat ones down to size
Before the barricades arise

[GAVROCHE]
Watch out for old Thénardier
All of his family is on the make
Once ran a hash-house down the way
Bit of a swine and no mistake

He's got a gang, the bleeding layabout
Even his daughter does her share
That's Éponine, she knows her way about
Only a kid, but hard to scare
Do we care? Not a cuss
Long live us, long live us!

[BEGGARS]
Look down and show
Some mercy if you can
Look down, look down
Upon your fellow man
