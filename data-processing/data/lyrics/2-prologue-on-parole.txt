[VALJEAN]
Freedom is mine
The earth is still
I feel the wind
I breathe again
And the skies clear
The world is waking

Drink from the pool
How clean the taste
Never forget the years, the waste
Nor forgive them
For what they've done
They are the guilty, everyone
The day begins
And now let's see
What this new world
Will do for me

[FARMER]
You'll have to go
I'll pay you off for the day
Collect your bits and pieces there
And be on your way

[VALJEAN]
You have given me half
What the other men get
This handful of tin
Wouldn't buy my sweat

[LABORER]
You broke the law
It's there for people to see
Why should you get the same
As honest men like me

[VALJEAN]
Now every door is closed to me
Another jail, another key, another chain
For when I come to any town
They check my papers
And they find the mark of Cain
In their eyes, I see their fear
"We do not want you here"

[INNKEEPER'S WIFE]
My rooms are full
And I've no supper to spare
I'd like to help a stranger
All we want is to be fair

[VALJEAN]
I will pay in advance
I can sleep in a barn
You see how dark it is
I'm not some kind of dog

[INNKEEPER]
You leave my house!
Or feel the weight of my rod
We're law-abiding people here
Thanks be to God

[VALJEAN]
And now I know how freedom feels
The jailer always at your heels
It is the law
This piece of paper in my hand
That makes me cursed throughout the land
It is the law
Like a cur
I walk the street
The dirt beneath their feet
