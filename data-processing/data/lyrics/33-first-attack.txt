[VARIOUS STUDENTS]
Platoon of sappers advancing toward the barricade!
Troops behind them, fifty men or more!

[ENJOLRAS]
FIRE!

[FEUILLY]
Sniper!

[BOSSUET]
See how they run away!

[GRANTAIRE]
By God, we've won the day!

[ENJOLRAS]
They will be back again
Make an attack again

[ENJOLRAS (to Valjean)]
For your presence of mind
For the deed you have done
I will thank you, Monsieur
When our battle is won

[VALJEAN]
Give me no thanks, Monsieur
There is something that you can do

[ENJOLRAS]
If it is in my power...

[VALJEAN]
Give me the spy Javert
Let me take care of him

[JAVERT]
The law is inside out
The world is upside down

[ENJOLRAS]
Do what you have to do
The man belongs to you

The enemy may be regrouping
Hold yourselves in readiness
Come on, my friends, back to your positions
The night is falling fast...

[VALJEAN]
We meet again

[JAVERT]
You've hungered for this all your life
Take your revenge
How right you should kill with a knife!

[VALJEAN]
You talk too much
Your life is safe in my hands

[JAVERT]
I don't understand

[VALJEAN]
Get out of here

[JAVERT]
Valjean, take care
I'm warning you...

[VALJEAN]
Clear out of here

[JAVERT]
Once a thief, forever a thief
What you want you always steal!
You would trade your life for mine
Yes, Valjean, you want a deal
Shoot me now for all I care!
If you let me go beware
You'll still answer to Javert!

[VALJEAN]
You are wrong, and always have been wrong
I'm a man, no worse than any man
You are free, and there are no conditions
No bargains or petitions
There's nothing that I blame you for
You've done your duty, nothing more
If I come out of this alive, you'll find me
At number fifty-five Rue Plumet
No doubt our paths will cross again

[ENJOLRAS]
Courfeyrac, you take the watch
They won't attack until it's light
Everybody stay awake
We must be ready for the fight
For the final fight
Let no one sleep tonight
