[ARMY OFFICER (from beyond the barricade)]
You at the barricade listen to this
The people of Paris sleep in their beds
You have no chance, no chance at all
Why throw your lives away?

[ENJOLRAS]
Let us die facing our foes
Make them bleed while we can

[COMBEFERRE]
Make 'em pay through the nose

[COURFEYRAC]
Make 'em pay for every man!

[ENJOLRAS]
Let others rise to take our place
Until the earth
Is free!
