[STUDENTS (together)]
Now we pledge ourselves to hold this barricade

[MARIUS]
Let them come in their legions and they will be met!

[ENJOLRAS]
Have faith in yourselves and don't be afraid

[GRANTAIRE]
Let's give 'em a screwing they'll never forget!

[COMBEFERRE]
This is where it begins!

[COURFEYRAC]
And if I should die in the fight to be free
Where the fighting is hardest, there will I be

[FEUILLY]
Let them come if they dare
We'll be there!

[ARMY OFFICER (off-stage, with a loud-hailer)]
You at the barricade listen to this!
No one is coming to help you to fight!
You're on your own
You have no friends
Give up your guns or die!

[ENJOLRAS]
Damn their warnings. Damn their lies!
They will see the people rise!

[STUDENTS (together)]
Damn their warnings. Damn their lies!
They will see the people rise!
