[ENJOLRAS]
Here upon these stones, we build our barricade
In the heart of the city we claim as our own
Each man to his duty and don't be afraid
Wait! I will need a report on the strength of the foe

[JAVERT (disguised as a rebel)]
I can find out the truth
I know their ways
Fought their wars
Served my time
In the days
Of my youth!

[PROUVAIRE]
Now the people will fight

[GRANTAIRE]
And so they might
Dogs will bark
Fleas will bite

[BOSSUET]
They will do what is right

[MARIUS (spotting Eponine, who is dressed as a boy)]
Hey, little boy, what's this I see?
God, Eponine, the things you do!

[EPONINE]
I know this is no place for me
Still I would rather be with you

[MARIUS]
Get out before the trouble starts
Get out, 'Ponine, you might get shot

[EPONINE]
I got you worried, now I have
That shows you like me quite a lot

[MARIUS]
There is a way that you can help
You are the answer to a prayer
Please take this letter to Cosette
And pray to God that she's still there!

[EPONINE (leaving for the Rue Plumet)]
Little you know...
Little you care!

[EPONINE]
I have a letter, M'sieur
It's addressed to your daughter Cosette
It's from a boy at the barricade, Sir
In the Rue de Villette

[VALJEAN]
Give me that letter here, my boy

[EPONINE]
He said to give it to Cosette

[VALJEAN (giving her a coin)]
You have my word that my daughter will know
What this letter contains
Tell the young man she will read it tomorrow
And here's for your pains

Go careful now, stay out of sight
There's danger in the streets tonight

[VALJEAN (reading the letter)]
"Dearest Cosette, you have entered my soul
And soon you will be gone
Can it be only a day since we met
And the world was reborn?
If I should fall in the battle to come
Let this be my goodbye
Now that I know you love me as well
It is harder to die...
I pray that god will bring me home
To be with you
Pray for your Marius, he prays for you!'"
