[MARIUS]
A heart full of love
A heart full of song
I'm doing everything all wrong
Oh God, for shame
I do not even know your name
Dear Mad'moiselle
Won't you say?
Will you tell?

[COSETTE]
A heart full of love
No fear, no regret

[MARIUS]
My name is Marius Pontmercy

[COSETTE]
And mine's Cosette

[MARIUS]
Cosette, I don't know what to say!

[COSETTE]
Then make no sound!

[MARIUS]
I am lost

[COSETTE]
I am found

[MARIUS]
A heart full of light

[MARIUS and COSETTE]
A night bright as day

[MARIUS]
And you must never go away
Cosette, Cosette!

[COSETTE]
This is a chain we'll never break

[MARIUS]
Do I dream?

[COSETTE]
I'm awake

[MARIUS]
A heart full of love

[EPONINE]
He was never mine to lose

[MARIUS and COSETTE]
A heart full of you

[EPONINE]
Why regret what could not be?

[MARIUS]
A single look and then I knew

[COSETTE]
I knew it too

[EPONINE]
These are words he'll never say
Not to me
Not to me
Not to me

[MARIUS]
From today

[COSETTE]
Every day

[COSETTE and MARIUS]
And it isn't a dream
Not a dream
After all!

[EPONINE]
His heart full of love
He will never
Feel this way
