[COSETTE (tending to Marius)]
Every day you walk with stronger step
You walk with longer step
The worst is over

[MARIUS]
Every day, I wonder every day
Who was it brought me here
From the barricade

[COSETTE]
Don't think about it, Marius
With all the years ahead of us
I will never go away
And we will be together every day

Every day
We'll remember that night
And the vow that we made:

A heart full of love
A night full of you
The words are old
But always true
Oh, God, for shame
You did not even know my name

[MARIUS]
Dear Mademoiselle
I was lost in your spell

[COSETTE]
A heart full of love
No fear no regret
"My name is Marius Pontmercy."

[VALJEAN]
She was never mine to keep
She is youthful
She is free

[MARIUS]
Cosette, Cosette!

[COSETTE]
I saw you waiting and I knew.

[VALJEAN]
Love is the garden of the young.

[MARIUS]
Waiting for you
At your feet

[COSETTE]
At your call

[VALJEAN]
Let it be
Let it be.

[MARIUS and COSETTE]
And it wasn't a dream
Not a dream
After all

[VALJEAN]
A heart full of love
This I give you
On this day
