[WOMAN ONE]
Did you see them going off to fight?

[WOMAN TWO]
Children of the barricade who didn't last the night?

[WOMAN THREE]
Did you see them lying where they died?
Someone used to cradle them and kiss them when they cried

[WOMAN FOUR]
Did you see them lying side by side?

[WOMAN FIVE]
Who will wake them?

[WOMAN SIX]
No one ever will

[TWO]
No one ever told them
That a summer day can kill

[SEVEN]
They were schoolboys
Never held a gun
Fighting for a new world
That would rise up like the sun

[THREE]
Where's that new world now the fighting's done?

[FOUR]
Nothing changes

[SEVEN]
Nothing ever will

[EIGHT]
Every year another brat, another mouth to fill

[SEVEN]
Same old story. What's the use of tears?

[FIVE]
What's the use of praying if there's nobody who hears?

[FIVE into ALL]
Turning, turning, turning, turning, turning
Through the years

[GROUP 1]
Turning, turning, turning through the years
Minutes into hours, and the hours into years	
Nothing changes, nothing ever can
Round about the roundabout and back where you began

[GROUP 2]
Turning, turning
Minutes, hours
Nothing changes, nothing ever can
Round about the roundabout

[ALL]
Round and round and back where you began!
