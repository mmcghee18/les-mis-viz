[EPONINE]
Cosette! Now I remember!
Cosette! How can it be?
We were children together
Look what's become of me

Good God! Oh, what a rumpus!

[MARIUS]
That girl, who can she be?

[EPONINE]
That cop! He'd like to jump us
But he ain't smart, not he

[MARIUS]
Éponine, who was that girl?

[EPONINE]
Some bourgeois, two-a-penny thing!

[MARIUS]
Éponine, find her for me!

[EPONINE]
What will you give me?

[MARIUS]
Anything!

[EPONINE]
Got you all excited now
But God knows what you see in her
Ain't you all delighted now?
No, I don't want your money sir

[MARIUS]
Éponine, do this for me
Discover where she lives
But careful how you go
Don't let your father know
'Ponine! I'm lost until she's found

[EPONINE]
You see, I told you so!
There's lots of things I know
'Ponine, she knows her way around
