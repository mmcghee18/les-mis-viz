[THENARDIER (assembling his gang)]
Everyone here, you know your place
Brujon, Babet, Claqusous!
You, Montparnasse, watch for the law
With Eponine, take care
You turn on the tears
No mistakes, my dears

[MADAME THENARDIER]
These bloody students on our streets
Here they come slumming once again
Our Eponine would kiss their feet
She never had a scrap of brain

[MARIUS]
Hey, Eponine, what's up today
I haven't seen you much about

[EPONINE]
Here, you can always catch me in

[MARIUS]
Mind the police don't catch you out

[EPONINE (grabbing his books)]
Here, whatcher doing with all them books
I could have been a student, too
Don't judge a girl on how she looks
I know a lot of things, I do

[MARIUS]
Poor Eponine, the things you know
You wouldn't find in books like these

[EPONINE]
I like the way you grow your hair

[MARIUS]
I like the way you always tease

[EPONINE (to herself)]
Little he knows... little he sees

[MADAME THENARDIER (to Eponine)]
Here's the old boy, stay on the job
And watch out for the law

[EPONINE]
Stay out of this

[MARIUS]
But Eponine—

[EPONINE]
You'll be in trouble here
It's not your concern
You'll be in the clear

[MARIUS (seeing Valjean)]
Who is that man?

[EPONINE]
Leave me alone

[MARIUS]
Why is he here?
Hey, Eponine!

I didn't see you there, forgive me

[THENARDIER]
Please M'sieur, come this way
Here's a child that ain't eaten today
Save a life, spare a sou
God rewards all the good that you do
Wait a bit— know that face
Ain't the world a remarkable place?
Men like me don't forget
You're the bastard that borrowed Cosette

[VALJEAN]
What is this? Are you mad?
No, Monsieur, you don't know what you do

[THENARDIER]
You know me, you know me
I'm a con, just like you

[EPONINE]
It's the police! Disappear!
Run for it! It's Javert!

[JAVERT]
Another brawl in the square
Another stink in the air
Was there a witness to this?
Well, let him speak to Javert
M'sieur, the streets are not safe
But let these vermin beware
We'll see that justice is done

Look upon this fine collection
Crawled from underneath a stone
This swarm of worms and maggots
Could have picked you to the bone

I know this man over here
I know his name and his trade
And on your witness, M'sieur
We'll see him suitably paid

But where's the gentleman gone
And why on earth did he run?

[THENARDIER]
You will have a job to catch him
He's the one you should arrest
No more bourgeois when you scratch him
Than that brand upon his chest!

[JAVERT]
Could it be he's some old jailbird
That the tide now washes in?
Heard my name and started running
Had the brand upon his skin

And the girl who stood beside him
When I turned they both had gone
Could he be the man I've hunted?
Could it be he's Jean Valjean?

[THENARDIER]
In the absence of a victim
Dear Inspector, may I go?
And remember when you've nicked him
It was me who told you so!

[JAVERT]
Let the old man keep on running
I will run him off his feet

Everyone about your business
Clear this garbage off the street!
