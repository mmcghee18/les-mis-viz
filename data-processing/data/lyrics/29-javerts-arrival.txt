[JAVERT (climbs over the barricade)]
Listen my friends, I have done as I said
I have been to their lines
I have counted each man
I will tell what I can

Better be warned, they have armies to spare
And our danger is real
We will need all our cunning
To bring them to heel

[ENJOLRAS]
Have faith! If you know what their movements are
We'll spoil their game
There are ways that a people can fight
We shall overcome their power

[JAVERT]
I have overheard their plans
There will be no attack tonight
They intend to starve us out
Before they start a proper fight
Concentrate their force
Hit us from the right

[GAVROCHE]
Liar!
