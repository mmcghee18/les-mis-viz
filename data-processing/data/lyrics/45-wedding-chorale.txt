[Chorus (overlapping)]
Ring out the bells upon this day of days
May all the angels of the Lord above
In jubilation, sing their songs of praise
(In jubilation, sing their songs of praise)
And crown this blessed time
(And crown this blessed time)
With peace and love
(Peace and love)

[MAJOR DOMO]
The Baron and Baroness de Thenard wish to pay their respects to the groom!

[THENARDIER]
I forget where we met
Was it not at the Chateau Lafarge
Where the Duke did that puke
Down the Duchess's de-coll-etage?

[MARIUS]
No, 'Baron de Thenard'
The circles I move in are humbler by far
Go away, Thenardier!
Do you think I don't know who you are?

[MADAME THENARDIER]
He's not fooled. Told you so
Show M'sieur what you've come here to show
Tell the boy what you know!

[MARIUS]
When I look at you, I remember Eponine
She was more than you deserved, who gave her birth
But now she is with God and happier, I hope
Than here on earth!

[THENARDIER]
So it goes, heaven knows
Life has dealt me some terrible blows

[MADAME THENARDIER]
You've got cash and a heart
You could give us a bit of a start
We can prove, plain as ink
Your bride's father is not what you think

[THENARDIER]
There's a tale I could tell

[MADAME THENARDIER]
Information we're willing to sell

[THENARDIER]
There's a man what he slew
I saw the corpse clear as I'm seeing you!
What I tell you is true!

[MADAME THENARDIER]
Pity to disturb you at a feast like this
But five hundred francs surely wouldn't come amiss

[MARIUS]
In God's name say what you have to say

[THENARDIER]
But first you pay!
What I saw, clear as light
Jean Valjean in the sewers that night
Had this corpse on his back
Hanging there like a bloody great sack
I was there, never fear
Even found me this fine souvenir

[MARIUS]
I know this. This was mine
This is surely some heavenly sign!

[THENARDIER]
One thing more, mark this well
It was the night the barricades fell

[MARIUS]
Then it's true. Then I'm right
Jean Valjean was my savior that night!
As for you, take this too!
God forgive us the things that we do
Come my love, come Cosette
This day's blessings are not over yet

[THENARDIER]
Ain't it a laugh? Ain't it a treat?
Hob-nobbin' here among the elite?
Here comes a prince, there goes a Jew
This one's a queer, but what can you do?

Paris at my feet, Paris in the dust
And here's me breaking bread
With the upper crust!

Beggar at the feast! Master of the dance!
Life is easy pickings, if you grab your chance
Everywhere you go, law-abiding folk
Doing what is decent, but they're mostly broke!

Singing to the Lord on Sundays
Praying for the gifts He'll send

[THENARDIER and MADAME THENARDIER]
But we're the ones who take it
We're the ones who make it in the end!

Watch the buggers dance, watch 'em till they drop
Keep your wits about you and you stand on top!
Masters of the land, always get our share
Clear away the barricades, and we're still there!

We know where the wind is blowing
Money is the stuff we smell
And when we're rich as Croesus
Jesus! Won't we see you all in hell!
