[ENJOLRAS]
The people have not stirred
We are abandoned by those who still live in fear
The people have not heard
Yet we will not abandon those who cannot hear
Let us not waste lives
Let all the women and fathers of children go from here

[FEUILLY]
Drink with me to days gone by
Sing with me the songs we knew

[FEUILLY and ALL]
At the shrine of friendship
Raise your glass high
Let the wine of friendship
Never run dry
If I die, I die with you
