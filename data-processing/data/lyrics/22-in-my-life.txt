[COSETTE]
How strange
This feeling that my life's begun at last
This change
Can people really fall in love so fast?
What's the matter with you, Cosette?
Have you been too much on your own?
So many things unclear
So many things unknown

In my life
There are so many questions and answers
That somehow seem wrong
In my life
There are times when I catch in the silence
The sigh of a far away song
And it sings
Of a world that I long to see
Out of reach
Just a whisper away
Waiting for me!

Does he know I'm alive?
Do I know if he's real?
Does he see what I saw?
Does he feel what I feel?

In my life
I'm no longer alone
Now the love in my life is so near
Find me now
Find me here

[VALJEAN]
Dear Cosette
You're such a lonely child
How pensive
How sad you seem to me
Believe me
Were it within my power
I'd fill each passing hour
How quiet it must be
I can see
With only me for company

[COSETTE]
There's so little I know
That I'm longing to know
About the child that I was in a time long ago
There's so little you say
Of the life you have known
Why you keep to yourself
Why we're always alone
So dark, so dark
And deep
The secrets that you keep

In my life
I have all that I want
You are loving and gentle and good
But Papa
Dear Papa
In your eyes I am just like a child
Who is lost in a wood

[VALJEAN]
No more words
No more words
Itâ€™s a time that is dead
There are words
That are better unheard
Better unsaid

[COSETTE]
In my life
I'm no longer a child
And I yearn for the truth that you know
Of the years
Years ago

[VALJEAN]
You will learn
Truth is given by God to us all
In our time
In our turn

[MARIUS]
In my life
She has burst like the music of angels
The light of the sun
And my life
Seems to stop as if something is over
And something has scarcely begun
Eponine
You're the friend who has brought me here
Thanks to you, I am one with the Gods
And heaven is near!
And I saw through a world that is new
That is free

[EPONINE]
Every word that he says
Is a dagger in me
In my life
There's been no one like him anywhere
Anywhere
Where he is
If he asked
I'd be his

[MARIUS and EPONINE]
In my life
There is someone who touches my life

[MARIUS]
Waiting near

[EPONINE]
Waiting here
