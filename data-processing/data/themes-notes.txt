orchestral parallels that i didn't mark:
- beginning of building the barricade (similar to look down and abc cafe)
- beginning of at the barricade
- drink with me playing in night of anguish
- first attack music
- second attack music
- the final battle music
- there's a parallel between valjean's last words in First Attack and his response in The Bargain, but it's so short
- beginning of "the sewers"
